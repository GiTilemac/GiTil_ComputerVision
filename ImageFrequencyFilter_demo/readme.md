### Medical Image Filtering (Moire Patterns) using Butterworth and Notch frequency filters
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### In the figures below, the 2-D Fourier of the original image, its filtered version, and the final filtered images are shown for each image and each Filter.

#### Image 1 Butterworth Filter  
Notice that due to the imprecise frequency filtering, the image has been blurred as a side-effect of the Moire-pattern removal.

 #### Image 2 Butterworth Filter  
Similarly, there are visual artifacts added to the filtered image.

##### Image 1 Notch Filter  
Due to the precise nature of notch filtering, the image quality is much better than the Butterworth version.
